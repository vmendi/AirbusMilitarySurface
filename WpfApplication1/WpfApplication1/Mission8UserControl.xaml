Flying faster (Mach 0.68-0.72) and higher (40000 ft/12200 m), it can respond more rapidly to crises, because greater distances can be flown. It is hence much more efficient than its predecessors. Also, as it can fly higher, it can cruise above turbulence, resulting in less fatigue for the crews and passengers or troops alike." />
